    <h3>Research and prototype a mobile experience that further engages an audience with one collection from The Met that is outside of the physical or traditional museum visit experience.</h3>
    <p>Digital museum experiences tend to focus on the 'learn more' model. This model assumes that the audience is looking for in-depth knowledge, but is that really the case? For this assignment consider and explore what other frameworks or models might be relevant.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify an audience and an exhibition for your project.</li>
        <li>Based on your research, define a mobile experience that serves the users' needs and interests. The goal is to use different research techniques to help you define a user-centric mobile experience that enhances the reach and engagement with the chosen exhibition.</li>
        <li>Use The Met's website and visit the museum to help you accomplish your project.</li>
      </ul> 
    <p>How can you learn about your audience and what they are likely to enjoy but might not know exists? What are their unmet needs? The Goal of the final presentation is to build a report summarizing your findings and to make a prototype of your project.</p>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <p>Create a mobile experience that will enhance how people experience The Met's art collection. The focus is on virtual assembly, participation and creating. </p>
    <p><i>universal issues / co-creation / local knowledge / learn from our past and integrate into our future</i></p>

    <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
    <p>Discover how viewers experience the museum, what is their emotional connection. What role does the museum play in their everyday lives and where is there opportunity for enhancement. Identify how the museum can be part of their local and virtual community.</p>

    <h3>Research Methods</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Observation/Field Study</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
              <li><b>Goal — </b>to see how visitors experience the art and the space at The Met.</li>
              <li><b>Methodology — </b>(1) note the visitors actions; (2) make a mind map; (3) check assumptions and note what is “certain” and what is “uncertain.” Prepare interview questions based on 4 or 5 topics. Observation will take place in one of the Met’s galleries and will include several participants.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Participatory Research</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
              <li><b>Goal — </b> to engage the user in the creative process.</li>
              <li><b>Methodology — </b>prepare topics/questions from the field study. Create a time line with “certain” + "uncertain" actions noted. Ask the participant to: (what) describe the things they do; (how) indicate good + bad moments (emotional); (why) explain motivations.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Interview Participants</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
              <li><b>Goal — </b>to meet with participants one-on-one to find out what they think about the topics/questions.</li>
              <li><b>Methodology — </b>(what else) ask for further explanations based on prepared topics/questions</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Interview Content Owners</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
              <li><b>Goal — </b>to understand the museum's perspective about visitors and the museum's current and future role within our culture and community.</li>
              <li><b>Methodology — </b>Reference: "What will museums be like in the future?
            Short essay collection by museum leaders and innovators from around the world"  <a href="http://wwww.museum-id.com">museum-id.com</a></li>
            </ul>
        <li>Concept Testing</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
              <li><b>Goal — </b>to share the value proposition of the new concept in order to determine if it meets the needs of the target audience.</li>
              <li><b>Methodology — </b>propose value preposition to participants and record their response.</li>
            </ul>
